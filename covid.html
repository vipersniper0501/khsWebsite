                    <hr>
                    <h2 id="august20">August 20 Additions</h2>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> My son was in JROTC for the past two years here, and my daughter who is a freshmen was also accepted to the program.
                     Both of them are doing virtual; saying that, I haven't seen anything regarding students in their situation regarding JROTC this year.
                     Are they still able to attend?
                    </em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> JROTC is unfortunately not available to students in the virtual environment.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> I heard students are not allowed to carry their backpacks to class and will have to use their lockers in transition times.
                     Won't this cause more personal contact with them all trying to squeeze into their lockers--most of which are top and bottom--at the same time instead of simply walking to their next class?</em>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> KHS will be limiting times that students may visit their lockers, and will be closely monitored throughout.</p>
                    <h2 id="august19">August 19 Additions</h2>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> When the students transition from class to class, will they all be walking in the same direction so they are not coming face to face?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> The corridors of KHS are such that students can transition between classes while maintaining appropriate physical distancing without having to require one way traffic.
                     In our commons, there are two sets of stairs which will be designated for one way traffic.
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Will there be after-school activities such as Cyberpatriots, National Technical Honors Society, sports, or other extracurriculars?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Yes, we will have after school activities, but they will be modified in some format.
                     Sports for the fall will include Cheer, Singles Tennis, Cross Country, and Golf. Winter and Spring sports have not been decided yet.
                     Other activities can be held with attention to physical distancing guidelines considered. Those clubs will be anounced at a later date.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="august18">August 18 Additions</h2>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Is Lunchtime Live still going to be a thing?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Lunchtime Live is legend-<em>wait for it...</em>-dary in our community! For those of you who don't know what this is,
                     it is a venue that KHS gives to students to share a talent during lunch. There are dance routines, songs, skits, and much more.
                     I can't wait to see this in person. Let's hope thhat we can get that geared up early!
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> There is a Facebook KHS Town Hall on August 18, and some families do not have Facebook and may choose not to have such social media.
                     Are there other ways for parents to stay connected?</em>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Absolutely, I will update this page frequently for questions and answers. Additionally, we will always utilize this website for information.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Where will students go to on the first day of virtual school? Should we check Schoology or wait for an email from our new teachers?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Students who utilize the virtual option will recieve notification from the DODEA Virtual School with specifics.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> If students complete their Senior year with the virtual school, will they be able to participate in the KHS graduation ceremony or festivities?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Once a Raider, Always a Raider. We would welcome full participation of all KHS students.</p>
                    <h2 id="august17">August 17 Additions</h2>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Can we wear face shields instead of face masks?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Good question; unfortunately no. DODEA requirements is that all staff, students, and visitors must wear a cloth face covering.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> I have multiple students at the school. If one of my kids is feeling sick, should I keep them all home?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b>If you have a child in your home that is showing any signs of Covid-19, please consider keeping each of your students home. This would apply to any of our schools,
                     and once you have been declared by a physician, or symptoms subside, you may send your students to school. If you are ever needing guidance, please reach out to our school nurse.
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Will we still be using the new rotation bell schedule or keeping red and white days?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> We will be using the red and white day schedule that was utilized last school year. The first day of school, August 24, will be a red day.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Will the seniors have all of their senior activities and trips?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> All activities and trips for any grade level are canceled to the fall. When we return to HPCON-Alpha, our district and our local command teams will offer guidance on which activities may return as normal.
                     You will have frequent updates from our Senior Sponsors this year with specific details. We encourage all senior parents to get involved in our Senior Committee, and be on the lookout for more details.
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Can a student doing virtual school use supplies from the school, with parents coming to the school to pick them up? (Supplies like art supplies, pieces of huge colored banner paper rolls, card stock, etc.)</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Parents/Guardians of students utilizing the virtual option will need to supply all items for instruction at home.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> How many classes should virtual students have?</em>  </p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Students should have 5 virtual school courses. In some cases, students in the virtual school option do not have a full schedule due to an incomplete course request submitted in the spring.
                     Additionally, some schedules are incomplete due to courses being requested that the DODEA Virtual School does not offer. Navigate to the 'Counseling' page under the 'Students' dropdown to find your student's counselor contact information.</p>
                    <h2 id="august13">August 13 Additions</h2>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> I heard in the USAG/DODEA Town Hall that in some schools backpacks are not allowed? What is KHS doing? Are we using lockers?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> Yes, backpacks are allowed for students. They will not be allowed to use them between classes, and will use their lockers as was the case in the past. KHS is fortunate to be a 21st Century school where corridors are open to allow for minimal to no congestion.
					 Obviously, students must wear face coverings while in corridors, at lockers, etc.
					</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> What is the protocol if a student tests positive for COVID-19?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> DODEA has provided a really nice visual flow chart that guides our steps. CLICK ME for a copy. Ultimately, we will be in close coordination with the Public Health Command, our military partners, and our District Superintendent's Office if this were the case.
					 I addressed this in the August 12 Additions below, but as reminder, yes I will be transparent with our community if we have a positive case to the maximum extent I can.
					</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> I have have heard the term "Grab and Go" related to lunch. What does this mean?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> To minimize congestion and contamination in lunch lines our AAFES partners will be handing out bagged lunches. Students will pick up lunch, and proceed to a seat to enjoy their delicious lunch. Students may still bring lunch from home, and we will have microwaves available for them.
					 Note: the August and September Lunch Menu is available in the Menu bar.
					</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> For virtual students who were placed in fewer than 5 classes, what should they do?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> If this is the case it may be due to an incomplete course request form turned in during the Spring registration process, or because a course that they requested is not available in the virtual environment.
					 Our counselors are working in close coordination with the DODEA Virtual High School and will be doing so to ensure complete schedules. If this is still the case by noon on August 20 please contact your KHS counselor.
					</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> Do students have the opportunity to switch back to virtual classes?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> The deadline to apply for the virtual option ended on July 28th. Once school begins on the 24th students will be committed for the entire semester and may not opt back to the face to face setting.
					 If you have any additional or more specific questions please contact either Mr. James or Mr. Jimenez (assistant principal). 
					</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> For virtual students missing in-person social opportunities at school, will there be other ways for students to connect, such as on a small group basis for a hike or dinner etc?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> Families that have opted for the virtual school option may continue to follow host nation and military command guidelines for activities at home. KHS will follow these guidelines as well when designing opportunities for students to interact outside of school hours.
					 Students may participate in extracurricular activities (athletics, clubs, etc.) regardless of their choice for instructional venue.
					</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> I watched the Wiesbaden HS town hall and learned that they are implementing a block schedule with only 4 classes per semester rather than 7 (as KHS had in the past) will we be following this same format?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> WHS is implementing a scheduling design called, 4X4. Essentially, students will complete a full year's course in one semester, they would have 4 classes per day, and each day they would have the same class for the semester. That is a overly simplified description, it is much more complex than that.
					 For KHS, we will be utilizing a block schedule as was implemented last school year. If you have a student who is not familiar with what a block schedule is, it is rather simple. We will have a total of 7 instructional classes spread over 2 days.
					 As example, the first day of school is August 24th, and students will go to 4 of their classes. This is called their "Red" day. On Tuesday students will go to their other 3 classes, and will also have a Seminar/Advisory class for a total of 4 classes.
					 Our school colors are Red and White, so Tuesday would be considered their "White" day. Classes rotate on that cycle for the remainder of the year.
					</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> Could you describe the daily schedule for virtual students? PC time vs work-on-your-own time?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> This is a challenging question, as it will vary depending on the class. All classes are self-paced, are blended between independent practice, online modules, digital assignments, etc.</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> Is there an available option to have students split between in person classes and online from home? This would mitigate a lot of possible spread. Is this an option? If so how do we register them?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> DoDEA has adopted 2 models for instruction. Students/families may choose between in-person or virtual. Of course, if something changes you will hear from me (Mr. James).</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> Will we still be able to ride the bus?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> Yes, and students must wear face covering while at bus stop and while on the bus.</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> Why can’t we separate students by grade rather than last name for lunch?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> KHS will not be separating students by grade or last name for lunch. We will utilize our neighborhoods to identify which lunch students go to. Students will have flexibility on who they sit with, where they sit with, but it must be done with a caveat... 6 feet apart when face covering is removed to eat.</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> Will the students have homecoming/prom?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> I have been practicing my dance moves all summer...not really:). At this time we will not be able to have homecoming in it's traditional setting. I really hope that we get to have prom!</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> When will orientation be and will clubs be able to set up booths around the common area?</em></p>
					<p><b>A:</b> Unfortunately, we will not have a whole school orientation this school year. Mr. James will be sending out information on how new student orientation and Freshman Academy orientation will be delivered. For clubs, we'll set up a format for those to be shared during our September Open House. Specific details to come soon!</p>
					<p><em><b>Q:</b> Will virtual students be able to sign out a chrome book from the school again if needed?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Yes, contact Mr. James.</p>
                    <h2 id="august12">August 12 Additions</h2>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> How will JROTC work? Like commanders call, combat dining in and all other activities JROTC affiliated activities?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> JROTC activities will be held to the same guidelines as classroom environments. 6 foot distance, face coverings, etc. I will work with the KHS JROTC instructors on dining requirements, and they will communicate directly with cadets.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> For the students who have chosen online school, will they be able to participate in extracurricular activities such as sports and after school clubs?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> DODEA's guidance is, Yes they may.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> How will KHS ensure that students and teachers have not been in the United States within the past two weeks, regardless of a negative Covid test upon arrival?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Another great question! KHS, and the entire district has confirmed arrival from CONUS for all staff members. No staff may return until after their 14 day quarentine, regardless of a Covid-19 test.
                     For students, I have coordinated directly with the AF and USAG School Liaison staff to ensure that command is communicating frequently. Additionally, you will see in my weekly communication information on this requirement.
                     If we hear of any family/student who is not adhering to this requirement, we will work directly with command to ensure compliance.
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> How will KHS ensure that hand sanitizing stations located around the building are fully stocked?</em></p>
                    <P><b>A:</b> We have designated 2 staff members to do visual check of hand-sanitizer stations at least twice a day. Bathroom soap dispensers are checked by our cleaning staff every day.</P>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Do the Covid-19 mitigation rules mean that students cannot sit with their friends during lunch?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Love this question! Please do sit with your friends at lunch. Remember while eating (since face masks are removed), to maintain 6 ft. distancing. We are opening up space within the building to allow flexibility. When done eating, put that mask back on and enjoy your friends' company.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Are students allowed to bring lunch from home? If so, will microwaves still be available, and how often will they be sanitized? Is there still going to be open campus for upperclassmen? What cleaning and sanitizing measures will be taken for eating areas?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Students may bring food from home, we will have microwaves available, students will need to sanitize between use. Between lunches, our cleaning staff will be ensuring that all surfaces are kept clean. We are working carefully to make sure that there is a big enough gap between lunches to do that.
                     I announced last week, August 5th message that we will not have off campus lunch until we recieve clearance from public health/command that it is safe to do so. Let's hope this is short lived.
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> How are the kids going to be separated for lunch? Is it going to be by grade level or last names? Will the students of KHS have separated lunches?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> We are working on finalizing our lunch schedule, we'll publish that soon. We are looking at 2 options right now, each of which allow us to monitor by neighborhoods who is at lunch. This will allow minimal numbers, flexibility with seating, etc.
                     KHS is not designed with traditional lunch tables like some schools may used to, so we'll have some flexibility...with parameters in place...and lots of supervision!</p>
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Will KHS be transparent in reporting the number of positive cases within the school?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Absolutely! Obviously, we will follow public health guidance in accordance with DODEA requirements, and confidentiality will always be maintained.</p>

                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Will hand sanitizer be available to the students?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Yes, KHS will provide hand sanitizer stations at the entrances and exits as well as throughout the school. Students will be provided time to wash their hands throughout the day.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Face coverings are important, so how will KHS ensure that students and staff are wearing them?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> DOD guidance requires face coverings at any time that physical distancing of 6 ft. cannot be maintained. At KHS, students and staff are required to wear face coverings:
                        <ul class="list" style="padding-left: 2em;">
                            <li class="list-item">While transitioning between classes</li>
                            <li class="list-item">When feet are moving</li>
                            <li class="list-item">When seated during class <b><em>IF</em></b> seated closer than 6 ft. apart</li>
                            <li class="list-item">One way direction will be used on stairways</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> How will KHS manage the number of kids congregating in the entryway of the building in the mornings?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Students may not be dropped off before 0750 each morning. Beginning at 0810, students will be released to their 1<sup>st</sup> period classes, and all students must be in their rooms no later than 0820.
                     Additionally, a second entrance/exit will be utilized before and after school in the area adjacent to the stadium near the windmill.
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> How will KHS ensure that commonly used items (computers, table tops, etc.) are sanitized frequently, and between uses?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> KHS staff will ensure that computers are sanitized using approved cleaning wipes/supplies before and after use. Students will not share computers without sanitizing between uses.
                     Table tops and other commonly touched surfaces will be cleaned by students and staff depending on the area of the building. We know that our students will be great partners in ensuring a safe learning environment for all.
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Wearing a face covering for seven hours a day is very uncomfortable; how will KHS ensure that students and staff have an opportunity to remove face coverings during the school day while also staying safe?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Within learning spaces and at teacher discretion, students will have an opportunity to remove face coverings as long as 6 ft. distance can be maintained. Additionally, KHS is designed with seven learning neighborhoods.
                     KHS administrators will coordinate with each neighborhood to ensure that staff can schedule mask-free breaks for students.
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> I love to volunteer at school, can I still come and see teachers and my student during the school day?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> We love volunteers, and we love it when parents get involved. Unfortunately, no visitors will be allowed past the front office without approval from administration. Sorry, we have to keep our learning environment safe.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> How will KHS respond when a student presents symptoms of COVID-19?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> First and foremost, it is critical that each and every parent commit and sign a form that the will commit to completing daily screenings as required for your student to begin school the first day. If your kid is experiencing illness of any kind they should stay home!
                     We will send the form to each parent via email, although you can see it by clicking <link href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vuy3inzVVxRi8pF5nAC_4yslKT7JEXCE/view?usp=sharing">here. When a student does exhibit symptoms of Covid-19, the procedure will be:
                        <ul class="list" style="padding-left: 2em;">
                            <li class="list-item">Teacher will notify the school nurse, and they will complete an evalutation of symptoms.</li>
                            <li class="list-item">If symptoms warrant further evaluation, the student will be placed in a quarantine room near the nurse's office.</li>
                            <li class="list-item">Parent/Sponsor will be notified, and student must be picked up within 30-60 minutes.</li>
                            <li class="list-item">Commonly shared workspaces within the classroom environment will be disinfected.</li>
                            <li class="list-item">KHS will follow reporting protocols as required through public health command and the District Superintendent's office.</li>
                            <li class="list-item">Student confidentiality will be maintained at all times.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> I heard that water fountains will be off limits, is this true?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Well, yes and no; students will be allowed to use water fountains to refill only water bottles, and will not be allowed to drink directly from the fountain.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> I also hear that students should bring their own headphones.</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Yes, this is correct. Personal use items such as headphones should only be used by a single student. We are asking all students to bring headphones with a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>

                    <p><b>A:</b> Students are required to wear face coverings at any time that a 6 ft. distance cannot be maintained. This will include bus stops, as well as on the bus. We ask that parents help monitor students at bus stops, remind them of requirements, etc. Students who do not adhere to guidelines may lose bus privleges.</p>

                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Can I still watch my student during practice?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> We love spectators, but we will not be allowing visitors during practice time so as to ensure safety for students and staff. DODEA guidelines are that we should not exceed 50 attendees.</p>

                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> How will KHS students be impacted during band?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> No musical instruments (reeds, instruments, mouthpieces) will be shared and students will utilize outdoor spaces when possible.
